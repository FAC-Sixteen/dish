## Planning & Organisation

![](https://i.imgur.com/94AxIHP.jpg)

We all had a pretty solid idea of how we thought the app would flow, and worked together to brainstorm ideas. We went through a couple of app names before deciding on dish!

![](https://i.imgur.com/7rNNFHM.jpg)

We whiteboarded out our initial database schema, but it quickly became a mess of arrows. We ended up using [DBDiagrams.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to sort it all out. We initally thought we'd have to make a new 'dish' table for each user when they created a dish, but decided instead on a 'transactions' table, which would hold all the dish adds, dish claims and community joins.

We also whiteboarded how our frontend would communicate with our server, and our server with our database.

We decided on a design-system very early-on, and found a nice font we could use for our 'logo'.

## User Testing

### Overall themes
* Easy navigation
* Confirmation pages
* Having to re-login after registration
* Info on communities
* Labelling and naming is not clear enough (dibs, collection, cooked)
* Too many clicks
* Too many scrolls
* Suggestion of a tinder-style swipe feature
* Drop down option of where you want to post the dish - i.e which community
* Create a dish page - unclear heading
* Grouping the logout link and profile pic as all 'logout' - need separate link for profile?

### üç≥ Insights from people who cook

**How do you like to receive feedback when you cook for others?**

*An honest but hopefully not too harsh text review I guess. More than just points/stars or its a bit pointless as feedback.*

*Verbally but also feedback on cooking is hard as I get very emotionally invested and then criticism is difficult*

*I don't, just eat it.*

###  üçõ Insights from people who eat

**What would you consider a fair portion size? (e.g. two cups of rice, a standard takeaway container)**

*"It's hard to tell, depends on the type of food... picture would help, it's easy to tell by seeing a container as well."*

*"If it fills up three-quarters of the plate, it's good!"*

**When you're choosing what to eat, what do you prioritise? ( e.g. portion size, cost, healthiness...)**

*Portion! When I choose what to eat I always think about whether it‚Äôs nice and filling.*


## GitHub Setup & Planning

We began by raising issues for each of our four user journeys. We then added issues for the user stories and put them as checkboxes inside the core user journey issues. This was really great as we could check off each of these once the task was complete.

Inside each user story, we then raised the development tasks that would need to be completed to make the user story happen:

We put all of this into a project so we could keep track of what was in-progress and what was coming up next:

## Technical Spike Research

<details><summary>Postgresql vs MongoDB</summary>
<p>


Main benefits of using MongoDB is it's flexibility as it doesn't have a schema, It uses nested json objects to order

Main benefits of Postgres is the rigity of the tables. it allows checks and error handling can be easier. There are more constraints. 

For this project, it would be morebeneficial to set up a rigid struct initialy rather than having a dynamic structure that could become error prone and difficult to structure.

<details><summary>Using Amazon S3 Cloud storage to host images</summary>
<p>


  - **Why** - Heroku does not allow you to save user-uploaded images. When the server goes to sleep, any user-uploaded images get deleted. AWS S3, or similar storage services, are important when architecting applications for scale and are a perfect complement to Heroku‚Äôs [ephemeral filesystem](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem).

### Today I Learned
- What a Procfile does
- Markdown tickboxes can be checked from a Github Projects issue
- You can make Github issues in projects
- Figma!
- Combinations of req.params (``'/:item-:type'`` as an endpoint) to handle multiple routes at once
-  How to pass objects into Handlebars templates and access different levels ("../"), iterating through a list, comparator helper functions
- How promises work???
- Boolean in SQL & checkboxes in forms - you can set defaults in your SQL build script

## Testing strategy 

Testing frameworks
- Jest 
- Supertest

Initially we tested the server routes using status codes. For the home route we tested for `<h1>dish</h1>` as we had no content at that point. We had unit testing on our helper functions as they were pure functions. 

Async testing in Jest was difficult; when introducing the database it changed our routes from rendering static pages to include async data. This broke all our route tests. After a lot of struggle we changed the route tests to include async build script before each test, and an "afterAll" script which would close the database connection before finishing the test run. We repeated this technique for our database tests. 

We set up code coverage with codecov and are now passing Travis CI.  

Further testing we would have added if we had more time:
- [ ]  404, 500,login and registration routes
- [ ] Logged in/ not logged in
- [ ] Jest mocks
- [ ] End to End testing
